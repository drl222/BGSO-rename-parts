# BGSO-rename-parts

To run, download the Python file from this repository (and Python itself, if you don't already have it). In the command line, run:

```
python BGSO_rename_parts.py [name of the folder containing all the files you want renamed]
```

All files with a hyphen in them will have what's before the hyphen swapped with what's after the hyphen. All files without a hyphen in them will have an underscore prepended to them if there isn't an initial underscore already.
